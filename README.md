# Thermal-Management-for-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Using-Ansys-Fluent

Ever wondered how lithium-ion batteries keep their cool while powering everything from your phone to electric cars? That’s exactly what I tackled! My mission was to prevent these batteries from overheating when they’re pushed to the limit.

I designed and tested cooling solutions like phase change materials (PCM) (basically, giving the battery a chill pill) and airflow systems to make sure they don't melt down.

Using ANSYS Fluent, I ran simulations to watch heat dissipate and tracked those sneaky hotspots trying to mess up the party.

I also used CATIA to help design and optimize the thermal management systems, making sure everything fit together like a well-organized puzzle.

It wasn’t just about keeping the batteries cool—it was about creating practical solutions that can actually be used in real-world energy storage systems, making sure things stay safe and efficient even under stress.
